# Decision_Tree
PREDICTION OF IRIS.CSV DATASET FOR DECISION TREE ALGORITHM USING SUPERVISED LEARNING MACHINE ALGORITHM 

# Problem starement
A American based botnical gardan grow iris flower in there labs but using bio technology in a single tree different type of variety flower is grow. as a data science engineer find out how much accurecy is there all catagories contain same species

# Load the Iris dataset

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets

# Create a Decision Tree classifier

# Train the classifier on the training data

# CONCLUSION:
According to my decision the model the flower not contain exact same species but only 1% species is found
